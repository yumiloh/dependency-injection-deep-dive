# Dependency Injection  Deep Dive

## Introduction

Welcome to the Dependency Injection Deep Dive series!

In this series I will attempt to explain how .NET dependency injection works from ground up. Perhaps you have heard of DI somewhere, but not exactly sure what the hell it does. Dependency injection itself already sounds fancy; sprinkle around a few more terms like service provider, service collection, singleton, scoped, or transient, and they will be floating around a newbie's head in confusion, not knowing what exactly they are and what exactly they do. Everything looks like magic. You _register_ it here, and the _container_ will _resolve the dependency_ according to the _lifetime_ you defined.

Wait a sec... Register what? At where? Resolve what? A... container will give me what I ask for, and grant me three wishes, perhaps? 

Regarding this topic, usually the more explanation is provided, the more confused I became. Okay, so you need to use _service collection_ to register it, and some _service provider_ will _resolve_ the dependency and the instance will be returned from the ether. Then, it gets _injected_ into the constructor, so the implementation gets _decoupled_ from the abstraction.

Where is the service collection? All I see is just `builder.Services.AddSingleton()`, apparently we should just register it like that? And it will somehow automatically be _injected_ into the constructor? Those were just the tip of the confusion I had in the beginning. If you are facing similar woes, I hope this series will provide more clarity.

A lot of rudimentary concepts in programming can be explained in simple and plain language, but whenever dependency injection enters the conversation, suddenly all the terms surrounding it become âœ¨so fancyâœ¨ at least that's what I thought when I first got acquainted with it as a junior. When I first heard of DI, I was wow-ed by its name. _Dependency injection_, huh? Gives a good roll of the tongue and make me sound knowledgeable, but in reality I knew nothing about it ðŸ¤£

Hopefully this series will demystify DI at the end and make this topic clear as day the next time you think of it ;)
