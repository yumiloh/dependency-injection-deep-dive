# Dependency Injection 

## Introduction

Welcome to the Dependency Injection Deep Dive series!

In this series I will attempt to explain how .NET dependency injection works from the ground up. Perhaps you have heard of DI somewhere, but not exactly sure what the hell it does. Dependency injection itself already sounsd fancy; sprinkle around a few more terms like service provider, service collection, singleton, scoped, or transient, and they will be floating around a newbie's head in confusion, not knowing what exactly they are and what exactly they do. Everything looks like magic. You _register_ it here, and it will _resolve the dependency_ according to the _lifetime_ you defined.

Wait a sec... Register what? At where? Resolve what? What lifetime? 

A lot of rudimentary concepts in programming can be explained in quite plain language, but whenever dependency injection enters the conversation, suddenly all the terms surrounding it become âœ¨so fancyâœ¨ at least that's what I thought when I first got acquainted with it. When I first heard of DI, I was wow-ed by its name. _Dependency injection_, huh? Gives a good roll of the tongue and make me sound very knowledgeable when I say it, but back then I knew nothing about it ðŸ¤£

Hopefully this series will demystify DI at the end and make this topic clear as day the next time you think of it ;)
